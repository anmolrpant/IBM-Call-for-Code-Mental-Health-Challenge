# IBM-Call-for-Code-Mental-Health-Challenge

CovAnSion is a predictive mathematical model developed to identify and alert necessary authorities of college students undergoing mental health effects, specifically, anxiety and depression, due to COVID-19. 
Student life is thought to be the most exciting part of life but the challenges that are associated with it are often overlooked.
Students undergo immense stress/pressure w.r.t academics, social life, and financial needs, as CDC has reported that 75% of all lifetime mental health cases start at the age of 24. 
And now, COVID-19 pandemic has made things worse for college students.

Virtual learning, on-campus housing evacuations, and laid off from part-time jobs have majorly impacted college students in COVID-19.
College students are dependent on part-time jobs as their source of income to support their living expenses and contribute to paying off education loans.
These factors have led to social disconnect, financial burden, anxiety, and depression amongst college students.
